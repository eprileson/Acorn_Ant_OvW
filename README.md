## Overwintering Project Scripts
Is there evolutionary divergence in Acorn Ant Overwintering physiology?
To find out, we ran a common garden rearing design for field caught urban and rural ants under overwintering conditions and then tested their heat tolerance, cold resistance, metabolic rate and survival

## Scripts
R code for each physiological measure under overwintering conditions

- Worker count / Survival
- Metabolic Rate
- Chill Coma Recovery Time (CCRT)
- Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax)
